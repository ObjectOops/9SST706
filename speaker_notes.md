# Speaker Notes

## Slide 1 - Significance

- The U.S. has becoming increasingly digital.
A lot of key infrastructure relies on computing technology.
- Systems are services are susceptible to cyberattacks, such as the electric grid, defense, elections, and private companies.
- A successful cyberattack can affect millions of people.

- "Threat actor" is an umbrella term that refers to groups or individuals who intentionally cause some kind of harm in cyberspace.
- Nation-states, or state sponsored threat actors, are a major focus of U.S. policy, but aren't the only ones who have the capability to cause damage.
- Various criminal organizations distribute ransomware that can be extremely costly for victim companies.

- The World Economic Forum surveyed that cybercrime and related insecurities are the 8th largest risk in the short term and coming decade.
- U.S. allies are also heavily affected. State-sponsored cyberattacks targeting NATO countries have tripled in recent years.
- Cryptocurrencies pose new challenges for law enforcement, namely in money laundering and law enforcement work. A lot of ransomware payments are facilitated through cryptocurrencies due to their inherent decentralized design, and because crytocurrency transactions are typically non-reversible.
- According to IBM, the average cost of a ransomware attack in 2022 can exceed over $4.5 million.

## Slide 2 - National Cybersecurity Strategy

- Differences between the Trump and Biden administrations' NCS policies may be subject to their political parties' ideologies.
- The five pillars of the 2023 NCA can be seen to the right.

## Slide 3 - NCS Commentary

- According to the ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association)... (see quote).

- This will require collaboration with the U.S. Department of State.

## Slide 4 - GAO Perspective on the NCS

- The GAO reported being told that there was no good objective way of accomplishing this. However, the GAO thinks that there should be, such as using monetary values for damages caused by cyberattacks as a means of measuring the effectiveness of measures taken against such attacks.

## Slide 5 - Agency Overview

- A lot of agencies operate under their parent federal departments or are an operational arm as in the case with the CISA and the DHS.
- This presentation covers some of the more prevalent ones.

## Slide 6 - CISA

- As mentioned before, the CISA is an operational component of the DHS.
- It protects sixteen critical infrastructure sectors as listed. For example, election infrastructure would fall under the government facilities sector.
- It also collaborates other government departments for these sectors, namely the departments of energy, defense, and the treasury.
- It must also work with the private sector.

- A set of CISA's core principles is called "secure by design".
- The general premise of these principles is for manufacturers to enable all security settings by default and keep security in mind when developing their products. Basically, security should be part of the product, not a separate thing that consumers or other companies have to search for.
    - They used seat belts as an analogy.
    - Also noted that transparency is important. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVE, record system is widely used to catalog security issues in commonly used software. The quicker a known issue is assigned a CVE and its record is completed accurately, the quicker people can react to mitigate it.
- CISA has received feedback from individuals, companies, trade associations, other government agencies, and from foreign agencies too, as shown to the right.

- CIRCIA is intended to be a step in consolidating the CISA's position.

## Slide 7 - DHS

- Although the CISA is an operational component of the DHS, the DHS also has its own role in cybersecurity.

## Slide 8 - NIST

- Note that NIST has roles besides those in cybersecurity.
- Develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines, best practices, and other resources for everyone to use.
    - They also keep track of CVEs.

- NIST has developed new kinds of cryptography that are resilient to quantum computing attacks.

- The OMB mandate may have come with or after the DHS recommendations.

- The framework integrates cybersecurity, privacy, and supply chain risk management.

## Slide 9 - NSA

- Despite well-known privacy concerns, the NSA actually seems to have a lot of oversight placed on it.
- Although these bodies are listed on the NSA own website.

- This court is a specialized federal court established by Congress via Article III of the Constitution.
